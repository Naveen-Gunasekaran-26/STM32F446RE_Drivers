The output speed register controls the speed of transition from LOW to HIGH or viceversa.
In other words it controls the slew rate of a GPIO pin switching.
Refer to the product datasheet for the values of OSPEED bits versus VDD range and external load.

RCC
====
RCC controls the clock for all the domains/buses (like APB,AHB buses).
While configuring peripherals, we have to configure these RCC registers for en/dis clocks and other clock associated functionalities. In refmanual goto RCC registers -> for eg : AHB1ENR
