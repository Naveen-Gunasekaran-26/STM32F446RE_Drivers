For Registersets - Refer reference manual rm not datasheet
For resistance value of Pullup/Pulldown resistors - Refer datasheet/ search "weak pull"
For speed of the outputspeedreg - Refer to the product datasheet / search "ospeed" -> it will take you to I/O AC characteristics table.
For alternate functionalities supported by a pin - refer datasheet / goto Pinouts and pin description -> Alternate function mapping.
For configuring the alternate function regs - refer datasheet of MCU, not rm of ST's MCUs
